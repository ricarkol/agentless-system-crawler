Crawlers
========
This repository houses config & metrics crawlers and logcrawlers code which is packaged for three purposes:

This is a container that runs the config & metrics crawler on VA infrastructure.

Tests
-----
<pre>
pip install -r tests/functional/requirements.txt
py.test tests/functional
</pre>
This runs functional tests.

There are also a lot of shell based tests in tests/ which need to be run as root, will leave files in /tmp and /root, will leave crawlers running on your machine and might delete all of your files.
