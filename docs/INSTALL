HOW TO DEPLOY A STAND-ALONE INSTANCE OF CLOUDSIGHT
-------------------------------------------------

The instructions below describe a stand-alone deployment of CloudSight
on a single host. These can be adapted for multi-host deployment by 
adjusting the host names in config/hosts.csdev accordingly.


1. DEFAULT REQUIREMENTS

1.1 A docker host running Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty with at least 32GB of memory 
and an empty non-root partition with 100 GB. Ensure this partition has no
data and can be formatted with a new file system.
Set up an ssh key for the root user on the host so that the user can ssh to 
localhost.

1.2 A running docker registry (https://docs.docker.com/registry/) where 
the container images we build will be hosted. The registry can be deployed 
on the same host as the remaining components of CloudSight.


2. CONFIGURATION

2.1 Replace the hostname `csdev.sl.cloud9.ibm.com` in config/hosts.csdev 
with your target docker host.

2.2 Point DEPLOYMENT_REGISTRY and CUSTOMER_REGISTRY in config/hosts.csdev 
to your docker registry from step 1.2.

2.3. Replace secreg2.sl.cloud9.ibm.com:5000 with the address of your 
registry in config/docker.config.csdev.

2.4 Replace `/dev/xvdc` in config/storage_devices.csdev with the
storage device name from step 1.1.


3. PREPARE THE SYSTEM FOR INSTALLATION
The following steps assume that $CLOUDSIGHT is the path to the source code
$HOST is the docker host where we are deploying and $REGISTRY is the docker 
registry (e.g. registry.ibm.com:5000)

cd $CLOUDSIGHT/deployment

./deploy-services.sh csdev true latest true

4. BUILD CLOUDSIGHT COMPONENTS

cd $CLOUDSIGHT/build
./build-all.sh $REGISTRY latest

cd $CLOUDSIGHT/deployment
./push-images-to-registry.sh $REGISTRY latest

5. DEPLOY CLOUDSIGHT
 
cd $CLOUDSIGHT/deployment
./deploy-services.sh csdev false latest false

Once deployment completes you should be able to view scan reports 
in the kibana dashboard at:

http://$HOST:8888/kibana/
