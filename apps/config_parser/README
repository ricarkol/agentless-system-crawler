The config parser service parses system and application 
configuration files emitted as 'config' features to the 
CloudSight broker's 'Config' channel and extracts the configuration 
parameters. Extracted configuration are emitted to one of three channels:
'User' - for system user account info
'Group' - for system group info
'ConfigParam' - for all other configuration parameters

The parser service relies on the Augeas configuration
management library <http://augeas.net/> to perform the 
extraction of configuration parameters. Augeas provides an
extensible set of lenses that each parse configuration 
files of specific applications or system components.

Data Format:
Features emitted by the parser meet the data format defined 
for CloudSight: 
  
Feature = < namespace, type, resource, value >

The namespace, is retained from the source data containing
the configuration. 

Type is either of 'configparam', 'user', or 'group'.

Resource uniquely identifies the configuration parameter.
For the 'configparam' feature type, it uses an XPath syntax
consisting of the file path and the parameter path. For 'user'
and 'group' features types the resource is represented by the 
user or group name, respectively.

For each feature type, the value consists of the following utf-8 string 
attributes:

user:
user     - user name
name     - full name
shell    - path to user shell
uid      - user id 
gid      - group id  
home     - path to user's home directory 
password - password 

group:
group    - group name
gid      - group id
password - password
user     - list of group users

configparam:
parameter - configuration parameter label
file      - path of file containing configuration
value     - string representation of configuration value
