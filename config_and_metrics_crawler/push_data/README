This dir has files that will push some data to the
the kafka instance for debugging. The script
push_data.sh  takes in parameters such as kafka instance,
metadata parameters (script can create a UUID based on
an index), etc.  The actual data is from a file "test1.0"
which was obtained by crawling a RedHat 7.1 instance.
